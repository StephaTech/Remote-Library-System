*************Explanation o code structure********************
I included the following entities
Book: modeling all data relevant to the users of the library as 
		isbn(as the id )
		title
		authorName
BookFactory
Cmdline 
Main
Reader: modeling all data relevant to the users of the library as 
		idReader
		
ReaderFactory
WaitingList
Menu
options 1 and 3 I code linear search it compares the element key sequentially with each element 
in the list BookInformation.txt and ReaderInformation.txt and is able to matches if is not then the search returns -1. Why I dindt used a binary search?
because the BookInformation.txt and ReaderInformation.txt is simple and small list



*********Design justification**********************
I design a menu 1 to 9 interacting with the user choices





**************Text file structure******************
As the libray doesnt have budget for a database I used txt.file for ensure persistency of the data for when the program is executed  automatically load
onto memory the data that exists on the path BookInformation.txt and ReaderInformation.txt
Necessary 
import java.io.IOException;
BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
Calling a method inside my class BookFactory.java as
	    private ArrayList<Book> loadBooksFromFile() 
	    final BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("BookInformation.txt"));
